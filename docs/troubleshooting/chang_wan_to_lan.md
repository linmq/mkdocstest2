# Change WAN to LAN

You can configure the WAN port of the router so that it can be used as a LAN port. That's useful when you are using the router in repeater mode which the WAN port is not required. As a result, you can have one more LAN port.

Especially for **GL-AR300M-Lite**, it only has one Ethernet port which works as WAN by default. Therefore, you must connect to it via Wi-Fi. However, once you have connected to it, you can change its WAN port to LAN so that you can connect to it via an Ethernet cable.
