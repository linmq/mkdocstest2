*Note: If your browser always redirects to Luci (http://192.168.8.1/cgi-bin/luci), you can  visit: [http://192.168.8.1/index](http://192.168.8.1/index) instead of [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1).*

  

### 2) Admin Password Setting
There is no default password for the Admin Panel. You have to set your own password, which must be at least 5 characters long. Then, click `Submit` to proceed.

### 3) Admin Panel
After the initial setup, you will enter the web Admin Panel of the router. It allows you to check the status and manage the settings of the router.
