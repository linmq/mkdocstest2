**Wi-Fi Name (SSID)**: The name of the Wi-Fi. It is not suggested to use unicode characters such as **Chinese**.

**Wireless Security**: Wireless encryption method.

**Wi-Fi Key**: The password of the Wi-Fi, which must be at least 6 characters long. We suggest you to change it when you receive the router.

**SSID visibility**: Whether to hide the SSID or not.

**Wi-Fi Mode**: You could select 802.11b/g/n or 802.11g or 802.11b.

**Bandwidth**: You could select 20/40MHz or 40MHz or 20MHz.

**Channel**: The router will not choose the best channel itself. You need to choose a channel manually. If your router is used as a Wi-Fi repeater, the channel will be fixed according to the connected wireless network.

Here is a list of supported dongles that we had tested before. 

| Driver                                 | Dongle        | Tested | Tested by       | Comments* |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------ | --------------- | --------- |
| RTL8811AU/RTL8821AU                    | AWUS036ACS     | Yes    | GL.iNet         |           |
