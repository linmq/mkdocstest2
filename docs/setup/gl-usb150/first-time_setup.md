## 2. Connect 

You can connect to the router via USB Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

*Note: This step only connects your devices to the local are network (LAN) of the router. You cannot access the Internet currently. In order to connect to the Internet, please finish the setup procedures below and then follow [Internet](internet.md) to set up an Internet connection.*



### Connect via USB Ethernet
This only works on computer with USB port. Plug in Microuter and then your computer will install the driver automatically. Lastly, it will create a **USB to Ethernet** network. For special situation, <a href="https://static.gl-inet.com/www/images/products/gl-usb150/GL-USB150_Windows_Drivers.zip">here</a> are drivers for Windows.

*Note: If your browser always redirects to Luci (http://192.168.8.1/cgi-bin/luci), you can  visit: [http://192.168.8.1/index](http://192.168.8.1/index) instead of [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1).*

  

### 2) Admin Password Setting
There is no default password for the Admin Panel. You have to set your own password, which must be at least 5 characters long. Then, click `Submit` to proceed.
