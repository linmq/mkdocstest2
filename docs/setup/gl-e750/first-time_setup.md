You can also plug the Micro USB power cable into the power port of the router to power on the device. That will also charge the built-in battery.

Make sure you are using a standard **5V/2A** power adapter. Otherwise it may cause malfunction.

## 6. Access the Web Admin Panel

Open a web browser (we recommend Chrome, firefox) and visit [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1). You will be directed to the initial setup of the web Admin Panel. 



### 1) Language Setting
You need to choose the display language of the Admin Panel. Currently, our routers support **English**, **简体中文**, **繁體中文**, **Deutsch**, **Français**, **Español**, **Italiano** and **日本語**.

*Note: If your browser always redirects to Luci (http://192.168.8.1/cgi-bin/luci), you can  visit: [http://192.168.8.1/index](http://192.168.8.1/index) instead of [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1).*

  

### 2) Admin Password Setting
There is no default password for the Admin Panel. You have to set your own password, which must be at least 5 characters long. Then, click `Submit` to proceed.
