#  GL-X300B

GL-X300B (Collie) is a compact and cost-effective industrial 3G/4G wireless router. 
Collie has X300B-RS485 version and X300B-IOT version (BLE or Zigbee).

Equipped with the external full-band 4G antennas, the aluminum alloy shell and the hardware watchdog, the mobile router ensures stable LTE connectivity in harsh and hazardous environments. 

Collie can also serve as a smart industrial Internet gateway with the functions of RS485 interface and the optional IoT module for a range of IoT applications including vending machines, charging piles, smart agriculture, metering, and more.
